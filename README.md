# Task3-Flower-Species-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
Welcome to the Flower Species Classification project! In this repository, we have developed a machine learning model to predict the different species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals. This project aims to demonstrate the power of machine learning in solving classification problems and particularly showcases its application in the field of botany.

**Problem Statement**
The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can identify the species of a flower based on the following input features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

**Methodology**
Our approach involves the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: We performed data cleaning, handling missing values (if any), and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Feature Engineering: We extracted relevant features from the dataset and standardized the data to ensure uniform scaling.
Model Selection: We experimented with Logistic Regression machine learning algorithms.

**Conclusion**
This project showcases the application of machine learning in identifying flower species based on sepal and petal measurements. We hope this repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in machine learning classification tasks and botany.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
